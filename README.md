There are three small subprojects in this project.
1) In the first task we have a table of three columns and three rows. When the user clicks on any element from the first column, the whole row is highlighted in blue, if you click on a special cell the whole table turns green, all other cells are painted yellow.
Color priority:
1.white
2.green
3.blue
4.yellow
White has the lowest priority.

2) In the second task is an input with validation of the phone number. When the number is not correct, the button is locked and shows a message about incorrect data entered. When the user enters the correct data, the button is unlocked and you can send the data and user receives a message about a successful operation.

3) In the third task, is created a basketball court. When the user clicks on the field, the ball moves, the bottom will show who scored the goal and the current score. The goal is scored in a small circle that has only 15px-15px.
